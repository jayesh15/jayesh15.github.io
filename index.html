								<h5 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/jayesh15/twitter-data-sentiment-analysis">Project Website</a></h5>
								Use the twitter API to create endpoints and fetch real time tweets of any user. Tweepy python library was used to authentication and extraction. The tweets are then cleaned using regular expressions ( removing hashtags, @mentions , RTs, emojis and URLs). Used pandas to converts the raw data into data frame and used NLP and sklearn libraries to generate the subjectivity and polarity from the data strings. Made a scoring system to generate a new column ( sentiment ) which holds positive , negative and neutral and values based on the polarity score , generated graphs and word cloud for better data visualization.<br><br>

								<h5 align="center"><a href="https://jayesh15.github.io/bigdata/">Project Website</a></h5>
								Novel Coronavirus or Covid-19 has created a pandemic leading to a worldwide
								shutdown subsequently affecting all sectors. This has raised alarms over one of the most overlooked areas to focus: Healthcare Management.With the increase in the number of cases, this tremendously increased the demand
								for beds and medical officials to handle the situation but predicting the demand for the next few months was very tough without the usage of data handling tools. This problem can be resolved by selecting precise big data tools to handle the data and data visualization so that the trend can be analyzed precisely and accordingly the demand would be satisfied.<br><br>

								For different cars and motorbike companies, it is difficult to apply marketing strategies on a variety of customers because customers buy things based on certain attributes like annual income, children, and marital status. To predict the group of customers, customer segmentation uses clustering algorithms to differentiate customers based on their data and thus making it easier for cars and motorbike companies to address the customers and increase the sales and revenue.<br><br>

								To support digitization which is being impeded because of lack of basic knowledge of operating computers and being well versed with the internet especially in rural areas this is still prevalent.

								Home Automation refers to the control of home appliances/ home devices through programming them as per our needs. This leads to an easy lifestyle for people living in that home as controlling devices/appliances over voice/gestures can lower the difficulty of performing tasks and thus saving time and energy. Home automation can be achieved using various degrees of intelligence and automation through a network. In this process, we make use of micro-controller to connect it with the network thus enabling us to program all the home appliances/devices as per our need. Home automation provides security, energy efficiency, and ease of use hence, it is adopted more. It also provides a remote interface to home appliances to provide control and monitoring on a web browser.</p>

								<h3 align="center"><i class="far fa-file"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using CRNN to Perform OCR over Forms</h3>
								<p align="justify">
								<b>International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology</b><br>
								<h5>Description: </h5>
								This paper presents the CRNN model used to perform OCR. The input image is a gray-scale image of size 128x32. After performing convolution via 5 CNN layers, the images are transformed into size of 32x256. The RNN part consists of 2 LSTM layers containing 256 nodes each to propagate information through the sequence and map the sequence to a matrix of size 32x80. Each element in the matrix is a score for the corresponding character(80 characters) at that particular timestep(32 time-steps). The CTC layer then uses this matrix to train along with the ground truth text. While inferring, it uses the beam search decoding algorithm to predict the output. The current model gives an error rate of 10.625% on IAM word dataset. This can be reduced by using Best Path Decoding or Word Beam Search algorithm in CTC. Since typically the words encountered in railway forms are proper nouns, Vanilla Beam Search algorithm is the best choice. An evaluation was done on forms filled by people having various handwriting styles. It was observed that handwriting styles matching the style of the IAM dataset,i.e. having more inter-word spaces and less intra-word spaces were segmented and recognized correctly.

								<h3 align="center"><i class="far fa-file"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic data collection from Forms using OCR</h3>
								<p align="justify">
								<b>International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology</b><br>
								<h5>Description: </h5>
								Optical Character Recognition(OCR) seems a very viable option for this case. However, blindly carrying out OCR won't produce any good results as there are many other elements in the form apart from the user's written data. This paper presents a structured way of scanning the paper-back form, collecting only the necessary, i.e. the user input data and update it to the database accordingly. The process involves using the scale-space technique to segment out the words from the input field and feeds them an input image to a CRNN(Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) model to perform OCR on those words provide us with output ready to be updated into the database. This automated system cuts down the waiting time and also increases the efficiency as compared to the current system being used.
